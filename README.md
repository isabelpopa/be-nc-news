# Northcoders News API

In order to successfully connect to the two databases locally, you must create two .env files: **.env.test** and **.env.development**. 

Into **.env.test** you will need to add ```PGDATABASE=nc_news_test```, which will connect to the nc_news_test database. Similarly, into **.env.development** you will need to add ```PGDATABASE=nc_news```, which will connect to the nc_news database.

These steps will ensure that you can run this project locally.
